    <!-- CEUR-WS.org proceedings volume number

         Take care: You usually don't know this number in advance, at least not in the case that there are multiple submissions to CEUR-WS.org on the same day.  We recommend that you ask in advance for a volume number, as explained in the “Procedure PUT” section of http://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html.
